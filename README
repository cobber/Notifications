Notifications version 0.01
==========================

Notifications provides a way for individual module authors to provide useful
information to applications without creating unnecessary dependencies.

Module authors simply create notifications:

    package MyModule;
    use Notifications qw( start note finish );
    start( "I just started" );
    note( "froobing the doble" );
    finish( "all done" );

Application authors can pick up these messages by creating typical logging
objects or specialised notification observers which capture the notifications
and pass them on to their final destinations:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Log::Log4Perl;
    use Log::Dispatch;
    use Notifications::Observer::Log4Perl;
    use Notifications::Observer::LogDispatch;
    use MyModule;

    my $log_d_derl   = Notifications::Observer::Log4Perl->new(    log => Log::Log4Perl->new(    ... ) );
    my $log_dispatch = Notifications::Observer::LogDispatch->new( log => Log::LogDispatch->new( ... ) );
    $log_d_derl->start();
    $log_dispatch->start();

    ...; # start doing stuff with MyModule
